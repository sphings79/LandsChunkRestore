# LandsChunkRestore
This plugin is an extension for the Lands plugin
It saves the chunk on /lands claim/create to a schem file.
After /lands unclaim/delete the chunk will be restored from the schem file
Thank you for using my plugin

Just drop the jar into your plugins folder.
There is no config.yml at this moment.

You have to install FastAsyncWorldedit and Lands plugins.
